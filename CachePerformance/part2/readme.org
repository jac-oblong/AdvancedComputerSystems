#+title: Maximum Main Memory Bandwidth

mlc's ~--max_bandwidth~ option is used for this part. Since main memory is targeted, the buffer size
(specified by ~-b~) will be left at the default (100 MiB).

The ~-l~ option can be used to control the granularity. 64B, 256B, and 1024B granularity was used.
