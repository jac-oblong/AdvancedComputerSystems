#+title: TLB Miss Ratio

In order to measure the effect of cache misses on the software speed performance, the same idea as
the cache miss experiment will be used. In this experiment, however, the contents of a vector will
be multiplied together, and different parts of the vector will be enforced to exist in different
pages using ~mmap~. The total number of pages can be changed to increase the likelihood of TLB
misses. In order to cause more misses, the multiplication will happen across pages instead of
within a page.
