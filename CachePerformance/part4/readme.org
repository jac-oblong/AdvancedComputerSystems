#+title: Cache Miss Ratio

In order to measure the effect of cache misses on the software speed performance, the indexes of a
~N~ length vector are multiplied. This is mathematically equivalent to calculating ~(N-1)!~. ~N~ is
varied to achieve cache misses for the different cache levels. The multiplication is done in two
different ways. The first way is iterating through the array sequentially, which should cause fewer
cache misses. The second way is iterating in a random order, which should cause more cache misses.
