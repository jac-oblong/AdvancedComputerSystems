#+title: Latency and Throughput Tradeoff.

mlc's ~--loaded_latency~ option is used for this part. Since main memory is targeted, the buffer size
(specified by ~-b~) will be left at the default (100 MiB).

The ~-r~ option can be used to require random access reads. The ~-e~ option can be used to ensure
that the prefetcher settings are not changed.
