#+title: Cache Performance Profiling

* Introduction

The objective of this project is to gain deeper understanding of cache and memory hierarchy
in modern computers.

* Experiments

** [[./part1][Part 1]]: Memory Latency with 0 Queue Length

This experiment uses Intel's Memory Latency Checker (mlc) to determine the read/write latency
of cache and main memory when the queue length is 0.

** [[./part2][Part 2]]: Max Main Memory Bandwidth

This experiment uses mlc to determine the maximum bandwidth of main memory under different
data access granularity and different read/write intensity ratios.

** [[./part3][Part 3]]: Latency and Throughput Tradeoff

This experiment uses mlc to measure the tradeoff between read/write latency and throughput to
demonstrate what queuing theory predicts.
