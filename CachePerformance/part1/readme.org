#+title: Latency when Queue Length is 0

Using mlc's ~--idle_latency~ option, the latency of the system with a queue length of 0 can be
measured. The ~-b~ option allows specifying the buffer size.

#+begin_src bash
sudo ./run.py
#+end_src

The results of the experiment can be found in [[file:log.txt][the log]]. It can also be seen in the graph below.

The graph shows that when the buffer size is low (i.e. it is targeting cache) the latency is also
low. As the buffer size passes ~25,000 KiB, the latency stabilizes because the buffer is now
targeting RAM, so the latency will remain consistent.

A zoomed in portion of the graph can be seen below. This excludes the larger buffer sizes, so that
the results of targeting cache can be seen more easily.

Here, the differences between the different cache levels is more obvious. There are three
horizontal sections: one below 200 KiB, one between 200 KiB and 750 KiB, and one above 750
KiB. These correspond to L1, L2, and L3 cache, respectively. Between the horizontal sections
there are steep increases in latency caused by the movement from one cache level to the next.
